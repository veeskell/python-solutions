# List less than ten

Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than the
number provided by the user.

This list will be used as an example for this exercise:

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]


## Extras

- Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a **new list** that has all the elements
less than the number from this list in it and print out this new list.
- Write this in one line of Python (through the usage of **list comprehension** and/or a **filter function**).
