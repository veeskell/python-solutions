# Odd or even

Ask the user for a number.

Depending on whether the number is **even** or **odd**, print out an appropriate message to the user.

## Extras
- If the number is a **multiple of 4**, print out a different message.
- Ask the user for **two numbers**: one number to _check_ (called num) and one number to _divide by_ (check).
If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

## Concepts learned
- Modular arithmetic (the modulus operator)
- Conditionals (if statements)
- Checking equality
- F-strings
